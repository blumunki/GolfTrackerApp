# Public Access Features

## Overview

The Golf Tracker App provides comprehensive public access to golf clubs and courses, allowing potential users to explore the platform's capabilities before registering. This document outlines the implementation and features of the public access system.

## Features

### Public Golf Club Directory

**Accessible Pages:**
- `/golfclubs` - Browse all golf clubs
- `/golfclubs/{id}` - View individual club details
- `/golfcourses` - Browse all golf courses  
- `/golfcourses/{id}/details` - View individual course details

- **Featured Golf Clubs**: Showcase of recently added or popular clubs
- **Feature Preview**: What users get when they register
- **Registration Flow**: Clear paths to account creation

## Implementation Details

### Conditional UI Architecture

The public access system uses `AuthorizeView` components to provide different experiences:

```razor
<AuthorizeView>
    <Authorized>
        <!-- Full featured experience with management capabilities -->
    </Authorized>
    <NotAuthorized>
        <!-- Public browsing with registration incentives -->
    </NotAuthorized>
</AuthorizeView>
```

### Authentication Detection

```csharp
var authState = await AuthenticationStateProvider.GetAuthenticationStateAsync();
isAuthenticated = authState.User.Identity?.IsAuthenticated ?? false;
```

### Data Access Patterns

**Public Data Loading:**
- Golf clubs and courses loaded without authentication requirements
- Network statistics calculated from public data
- No personal or sensitive information exposed

**Authenticated Data Loading:**
- Personal performance data only for logged-in users
- Management capabilities (add/edit/delete) restricted to authenticated users
- User-specific analytics and tracking features

## User Experience
