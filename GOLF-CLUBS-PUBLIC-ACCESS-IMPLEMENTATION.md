#### Key Changes:
- **Removed:** `[Authorize]` attribute
- **Added:** Authentication status checking
- **Enhanced:** Conditional UI based on authentication status:
  - **Authenticated users:** See hole management (add/edit/delete), personal performance data
  - **Non-authenticated users:** See read-only hole information and performance tracking call-to-action
- **Added:** Registration and login call-to-action buttons
- **Maintained:** Personal performance data only for authenticated users

## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Pattern Used
```csharp
// Check authentication status
var authState = await AuthenticationStateProvider.GetAuthenticationStateAsync();
isAuthenticated = authState.User.Identity?.IsAuthenticated ?? false;
```

### Conditional UI Pattern
```razor
<AuthorizeView>
    <Authorized Context="authContext">
        <!-- Admin/Management functionality -->
    </Authorized>
    <NotAuthorized Context="authContext">
        <!-- Public view with registration prompts -->
    </NotAuthorized>
</AuthorizeView>
```

### Context Naming Resolution
Fixed multiple instances of context naming conflicts between `AuthorizeView` and `MudTable` by using:
```razor
<Authorized Context="authContext">
```

## User Experience Improvements

### For Non-Authenticated Users:
1. **Browse Clubs:** Can view all golf clubs with basic information
2. **View Courses:** Can see course details including hole information
3. **Network Overview:** See statistics about clubs, courses, and countries
4. **Clear Path to Registration:** Multiple call-to-action buttons and prompts
5. **Informative Content:** Explanatory text about benefits of joining

### For Authenticated Users:
1. **Full Management:** Complete CRUD operations on clubs and courses
2. **Personal Data:** Access to performance tracking and analytics
3. **Enhanced Features:** All existing functionality preserved
4. **Seamless Experience:** No disruption to current workflows

## Security Considerations
- **Read-Only Access:** Public users can only view data, not modify
- **Performance Data Protected:** Personal analytics only visible to authenticated users
- **Admin Functions Protected:** Management operations require authentication
- **Service Layer Unchanged:** No changes to business logic or data access security

## Benefits Achieved
1. **Marketing Tool:** Showcases available clubs and courses to potential users
2. **User Acquisition:** Clear registration paths encourage sign-ups
3. **Transparency:** Demonstrates value of the platform before registration
4. **SEO Potential:** Public pages can be indexed by search engines
5. **Reduced Friction:** Users can evaluate the platform without barriers

## Files Modified/Created
- `ListGolfClubs.razor` - Enhanced with public access
- `GolfClubDetails.razor` - Enhanced with public access  
- `ListGolfCourses.razor` - Enhanced with public access
- `GolfCourseDetails.razor` - Enhanced with public access
- Backup files removed (had conflicting routes):
  - `AuthenticatedListGolfClubs.razor` ❌ 
  - `AuthenticatedGolfClubDetails.razor` ❌
  - `AuthenticatedGolfCourseDetails.razor` ❌

## Testing Results
- ✅ Application builds successfully
- ✅ Application runs without errors
- ✅ Public access to golf clubs page works
- ✅ Public access to golf courses page works
- ✅ Authentication status properly detected
- ✅ Conditional UI renders correctly
- ✅ Registration prompts display appropriately
- ✅ Route conflicts resolved (removed backup files with duplicate routes)

## Issues Resolved
### Route Conflict Issue
**Problem**: `AmbiguousMatchException` due to multiple files having the same `@page` directives
**Cause**: Backup files (`AuthenticatedListGolfClubs.razor`, `AuthenticatedGolfClubDetails.razor`, `AuthenticatedGolfCourseDetails.razor`) contained the same routes as the new public-access files
**Solution**: Removed backup files to eliminate route conflicts
**Files Removed**:
- `AuthenticatedListGolfClubs.razor` (had `/golfclubs` route)
- `AuthenticatedGolfClubDetails.razor` (had `/golfclubs/{ClubId:int}` route)  
- `AuthenticatedGolfCourseDetails.razor` (had `/golfcourses/{CourseId:int}/details` route)

## Next Steps Recommendations
1. Test all public pages thoroughly for UI/UX
2. Consider adding course search/filtering for public users
3. Implement basic SEO meta tags for public pages
4. Add analytics tracking for public user behavior
5. Consider public API endpoints for club/course data
6. Test registration conversion flows from public pages

## Conclusion
Successfully transformed the Golf Clubs area from authenticated-only to a public showcase that encourages user registration while maintaining full security and functionality for existing authenticated users.
